## 4. Conditional Probability

**Conditional probability** is defined as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome.

**Conditional probability** is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.
