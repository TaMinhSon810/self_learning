# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
## 1. Mean
**Mean** is the average of the given numbers and is calculated by dividing the sum of given numbers by the total number of numbers. 

``Mean = (Sum of all the observations/Total number of observations)``

- **Sample Mean**: an average of a set of data. The ***sample mean*** can be used to calculate the central tendency, standard deviation and the variance of a data set.

- **Population means**: the mean or average of all values in the given population. It is calculated by the sum of all values in the population

**Example**: 
What is the mean of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?

***Solution:***
2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

Mean = 30/5 = 6

## 2. Median
**Median** is the middle value of a set of data. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be arranged in ascending order:

- `If there is an odd amount of numbers`, the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.
- `If there is an even amount of numbers in the list`, the median is the average of the two middle values.

**Median of grouped data** is the middle value of the data that is arranged in ascending order and written in a continuous manner. The data is in the form of a frequency distribution table that divides the higher level of data from the lower level of data.

**Example**:

**Solution**:

In this example, there are N = 40 total values. Thus, the median value lies in the class where 40/2 = 20 is located. The 20th largest value would be located in the 71-80 class.

Knowing this, we can calculate the following values:

`L: Lower limit of median class:` 71
`W: Width of median class:` 9
`N: Total Frequency:` 40
`C: Cumulative frequency up to median class:` 12
`F: Frequency of median class:` 15
We can plug these values into the formula to calculate the median of the distribution:

**Median** = L + W[(N/2 – C) / F]

**Median** = 71 + 9[(40/2 – 12) / 15]

**Median** = 75.8

We estimate that the median exam score is 75.8.

## 3. Mode
**Mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

**Example:** 
In the given set of data: 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, the mode of the data set is 5 since it has appeared in the set twice.

## 4. Quantiles, Range and IQR

### 4.1. Quantiles

**Quantiles** are values that split sorted data or a probability distribution into equal parts. In general terms, a q-quantile divides sorted data into q parts. The most commonly used quantiles have special names:

- `Quartiles (4-quantiles)`: Three quartiles split the data into four parts.

- `Deciles (10-quantiles)`: Nine deciles split the data into 10 parts.

- `Percentiles (100-quantiles)`: 99 percentiles split the data into 100 parts

**Quartiles** are a type of percentile. A percentile is a value with a certain percentage of the data falling below it. In general terms, k% of the data falls below the kth percentile:

- `The first quartile (Q1, or the lowest quartile)` is the 25th percentile, meaning that 25% of the data falls below the first quartile.

- `The second quartile (Q2, or the median)` is the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of the data falls below the second quartile.

- `The third quartile (Q3, or the upper quartile)` is the 75th percentile, meaning that 75% of the data falls below the third quartile.

### 4.2. Range and IQR

**Range** measures the difference between the minimum value and the maximum value in a dataset.

`Range = Max - Min`

**Interquartile range (IQR)** measures the difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile) in a dataset. This represents the spread of the middle 50% of values

`IQR = Q3 – Q1`
